# Hosting_Website

A web project focused on providing hosting services informationâ€”particularly tailored toward game server hosting (with emphasis on Minecraft). The goal is to present a clean landing site where users can explore hosting plans, learn about features, and initiate contact or service setup.

## Purpose

- Showcase hosting plans (e.g., Minecraft server tiers)
- Communicate performance, uptime, and support guarantees
- Offer a clear call to action (purchase, inquiry, or signup)
- Provide an extensible base for future automation (e.g., order forms, panel integration)

## Core Concepts (Planned / Typical)

- Plan comparison (RAM, player slots, storage, CPU priority)
- Game focus (Minecraft first; expandable to other games)
- Contact / request form
- Pricing presentation
- FAQ and support guidance section
- Possibly integration points for a control panel (e.g. Pterodactyl) in the future

## Current Stack

- Primary language: HTML (static structure)
- Styling: (Add CSS framework or custom styles if present)
- License: GPL-3.0 (open for community adaptation)

(You can update this once CSS/JS assets are added.)

## Suggested Directory Structure

```
/assets
  /css
  /img
  /js
index.html
plans.html        (optional)
contact.html      (optional)
faq.html          (optional)
```

Adjust this section to reflect actual files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Apoliak7777/Hosting_Website.git

3. Customize content (plans, pricing, feature lists) inside the HTML files.

## Recommended Next Improvements

- Add a unified CSS theme and responsive layout
- Create a JSON or JS config for hosting plans to avoid hard-coded duplication
- Implement a lightweight JavaScript pricing toggle (monthly vs. quarterly)
- Add meta tags (SEO, Open Graph)
- Add favicon and branding assets
- Integrate a request form (email submission or webhook)
- Prepare future backend integration (billing / provisioning)
